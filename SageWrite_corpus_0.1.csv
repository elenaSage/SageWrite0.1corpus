Inositol Phosphate (IP) Signalling
The first enzyme target of Li+ identified was inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) [1]. This dephosphorylates inositol monophosphate to release myo-inositol, which is then transferred to diacyl glycerol to form phosphatidyl inositol (PI). This is then further phosphorylated on the inositol ring to create a range of lipid molecules with various signalling functions (Fig. 1A). The two most studied are PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) [2, 3] although other lipids, such as PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2 are important in membrane trafficking in the cell [4]. Inositol monophosphate is formed by dephosphorylation of the soluble inositol phosphate, I(1,4,5)P3 (IP3) by specific IP3 5’phosphatases to I(1,4)P2 and then further dephosphorylation by inositol 1-polyphosphate phosphatase (IPP), a second lithium sensitive enzyme with a protein structure closely related to IMPase [5] (Fig. 1A). Alternatively myo-inositol is synthesised de novo by isomerisation of glucose-6-phosphate through the action of inositol synthase (Ino1) [6]. As a consequence cellular synthesis of myo-inositol is sensitive to Li+. This has the potential to deplete the cellular concentration of inositol, however in many cases inositol can be taken up from the environment via transporter proteins in the membrane [6]. A significant change in IP signalling due to inositol depletion presumably occurs in cells where environmental inositol is low, however in some conditions Li+ and other mood stabilizers may also lower inositol up-take potentially enhancing their effects [7].","BIOCHEMICAL TARGETS OF LITHIUM:

IMPase (inositol monophosphatase) was the first enzyme target of lithium to be identified [1]. This enzyme target dephosphorylates inositol monophosphate to release myo-inositol, that gets in turn transferred to diacyl glycerol, making phosphatidyl inositol (PI). PI then gets further phosphorylated on its inositol ring, making an assortment of various signalling lipid molecules (Fig. 1A).

Another route for de novo myo-inositol synthesis is isomerisation of glucose-6-phosphate via inositol synthase (Ino1) [6]. This makes cellular synthesis of myo-inositol sensitive to Li+ presence, meaning that there is the potential to deplete inositol reserves in the cell, however,  inositol has the ability to be taken up from the environment in many cases via transporter proteins of the cell membrane [6]. Presumably, though, there is a significant change in IP signalling due to inositol depletion when it is low in the environment, however, there are conditions were a possibility exists for Li+ and other mood stabilizers to lower up-take of inositol, thus enhancing their effects.",0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

sample complexity of algorithm n = O(k log(1/δ)/ε) is independent of ambient dim d -- an ideal situation.

Explanation of the above example - 
even under the strongest assumptions (for example, the data lies exactly in a rank-1 subspace), any good approximation to the subspace, to the data matrix X, or to the covariance matrix A = XXT must require the sample complexity n to grow polynomially in the ambient dimension d provided that we restrict to techniques that satisfy concentrated differential privacy. 
Almost all previous work in this general area is subject to this restriction.","Why is concentrated differential privacy incompatible with dimension independent guarantees?
Briefly, let there be input X1 = X2 = · · · = Xn = ξ/ d for a uniformly random ξ ∈ {−1, +1}d. (The input is a random point with n repetitions.) Here, if M satisﬁes O(1)-concentrated differential privacy, it also satisﬁes mutual information bound I(M(X); X) ≤ O(n2) [BS16]. But if M gives a good approximation of X or A = XXT, an approximation to ξ from its output must be possible. It follows that I(M(X); X) ≥ Ω(d), since the entropy of X is d bits.
With that, you end up with a lower bound where n ≥ Ω(d) (taking into account that X and A are rank k = 1). 
This shows that, with strongest assumptions where data lies precisely in rank-1 subspace, any decent approximation to subspace, matrix X , or covariance matrix (A = XXT) needs n (sample complexity) to be growing in ambient dim d (if limited to the techniques satisfying concentrated differential privacy--something almost all the past work in this space is restricted to).

high score to the correct subspace, and assigns a low score to all other subspaces. Then we can
simply apply a GAP-MAX algorithm to privately select the correct subspace [BDRS18].The GAP-MAX algorithm satisﬁes (ε, δ)-differential privacy and outputs the correct subspace
as long as the gap between its score and that of any other subspace is larger than O(log(1/δ)/ε).
This works even though there are inﬁnitely many subspaces to consider, which would not be
possible under concentrated differential privacy.The simplest score function would simply be the number of input points that the subspace
contains. This assigns high score to the correct subspace, but it also assigns high score to any
larger subspace that contains the correct subspace. To remedy this, we subtract from the score
the number of points contained in a strictly smaller subspace. That is, the score of subspace S
(cid:48) (cid:40) S of the number of
is the number of points in S minus the maximum over all subspaces S
points contained in S.(cid:48)This GAP-MAX approach easily solves the exact case, but it does not readily extend to the
approximate case. If we count points near to the subspace, rather than in it, then (inﬁnitely)
many subspaces will have high score, which violates the assumptions needed for GAP-MAX to
work. Thus we use a completely different approach for the approximate case.","1.4 Our Techniques:
In the exact case, a score function for the subspaces is developed, which assigns a high score to the correct subspace and a low score to the others, and has low sensitivity
The GAP-MAX algorithm is subsequently used to privately select the correct subspace [BDRS18]
This algorithm outputs the correct subspace if the gap between its score and the score of any other subspace is greater than O(log(1/δ)/ε), while maintaining (ε, δ)-differential privacy
Functionality is preserved when considering infinitely many subspaces, which is not possible under concentrated differential privacy
The most simple score function would be the number of input points found in the subspace
This would assign a high score to the correct subspace, but would also assign a high score to a large subspace that contains the correct subspace
This is handled by subtracting the number of points contained in a strictly smaller subspace from the score
That is, the score of subspace S (cid:48) (cid:40) S of the number of is the number of points in S minus the maximum over all subspaces S points contained in S.(cid:48)
The GAP-MAX algorithm can handle the exact case easily, but is not immediately extendible to the approximate case
If points near the subspace are counted, rather than those in the subspace, then infinitely many subspaces will be assigned a high score, leaving the GAP-MAX useless
Therefore a different approach must be used for the approximate case","1.4 Our Techniques

This GAP-MAX approach solves well the exact case yet it does not readily extend to the approximate case.
If we count points near to the subspace, rather than count points in it, then (inﬁnitely) many subspaces will have high score, this violates the assumptions needed for GAP-MAX to work. So for this reason we use a completely different approach for the approximate case.","1.4 Techniques

in exact case:
- construct score function for subspaces with low sensitivity that gives high score to right subspace and low score to all others
- then just use GAP-MAX algorithm to make private selection of right subspace [BDRS18]. (GAP-MAX has (ε, δ)-differential privacy, gives right subspace when score gap is > O(log(1/δ)/ε) between correct/incorrect, even though there are infinite subspaces -- something not possible under concentrated differential privacy.)

simplest score function is equal to number of input points in subspace: gives high score to accurate subspace and any bigger subspace containing it. 
As a fix, we subtract the number of points in strictly smaller subspace, so that score of subspace S is the number of points in S minus the maximum over all subspaces S of all points contained in S.(cid:48).

Using GAP-MAX is an easy solution for the exact case but can't be extended to the approximate. If counting points near (but not in) subspace, infinite subspaces end up with high scores, violating GAP-MAX assumptions. 

So the approximate case needs a different approach altogether.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Introduction","In course of continuing COVID-19 pandemic, retaliations on nations' political, socio-cultural, and, more than ever, economics are deemed (or are yet) dire.
This paper discusses leaders' reactions in Europe to emergence of COVID-19 and undercurrents, put in terms of power and discourse of European Union broadly.
First part is to introduce chronology of diffusion of virus (from China to Europe, especially Italy).
Later part gives focus on first reaction of EU politicians to epidemic as it grew to international recognitions as global pandemic.
It then moves to second most damaged EU-sphere country, Spain.
And last, is a comparison of state's reactions by employ methodological comparison of units and discourse analysis--the foundation of this research.
Final aim of paper is to look for patterns in EU leadership communications of emergency due to COVID-19 in EU framework, while thinking of the differences between EU as Union and as compound of sovereign nation-states.

26,98,"This is the publicly known version of the events.  
Nevertheless, as argued by Fuchs (2020), some insights into the communication 
of the ideology behind the context of coronavirus can be revealing of future inter-
national scenarios. For instance, media coverage of the event was only following 
the main pathways of transmission and media were predominantly giving the fault 
to specific targets. In the beginning, it was the Chinese people and, then, the Ital-
ians. As time passed by, it was also the Spanish people. Never have we ever heard 
of the Middle Eastern people of Iran as “untore”. Indeed, it was never the Iranians, 
who  are  harshly  suffering  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  they  were  already  out-
side of our western cultures and societies. War regimes, as a visa in their passports, 
a permit of entrance and residence, are its distinctive mark, a mark that only qua-
rantine allowed us to speculate on and empathize with, now, at the beginning of the 
new decade (Teller, 2015).  So China, Iran, Italy, Spain, the USA. How did leaders react to the spread of the 
pandemic in Europe? Where are we now? Shall we talk about a globalized world? 
An  EU  environment?  Or  shall  we  look  for  antagonistic/egoistic  lanes,  remain  in 
our neo-realistic vision and opt for nation-states priorities inside the structure of the 
international system? ","This is the version of the events known by the public
However, Fuchs (2020) argued that insights could be drawn from how ideology was communicated regarding the coronavirus, and could inform future international scenarios
As an example, the media only followed the main pathways of transmission and assigned blame to specific targets
First, blaming the Chinese, then the Italians, then the Spanish
Despite being hit hard by the virus, Iranians were never treated as ""untore"", or plague spreaders
They could not have been the main spreaders, as Iran remains outside the western world
So how did leaders react to the spread of the virus in Europe? What is the current state? Should we take a global perspective? An EU perspective? Or will we continue to prioritize nation-state interests and continue antagonism/egoism?","this is the version of events in public knowledge
nevertheless as Fuchs (2020) argued some insights into the communication of the ideology behind the context of coronavirus can give insights for future international scenarios
an example - media coverage of the even was only following the main pathways of transmission and media were largely giving the fault to specific targets
so at the start it was the Chinese people and after that the Italians. 
As time went on it was also the Spanish people. never was heard of the Middle Eastern people of Iran as “untore”. Indeed, it was never the Iranians, who are harshly suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic, they were already outside of our western cultures and societies.
War regimes, as a visa in their passports, a permit of entrance and residence, are its distinctive mark, a mark that only quarantine allowed us to speculate on and empathize with, now, at the beginning of the new decade (Teller, 2015).

That said, Fuchs (2020) argues that communication of ideology behind context of coronavirus can be useful for future international scenarios, e.g., the media followed only main transmission pathways and gave fault to certain groups: first Chinese people, then Italian people. (Over time, also Spanish people.) Never was it Middle Eastern people from Iran who were ""untore"" -- never Iranians, who suffer badly from COVID-19, because they are outside of western culture and society.
War regimes: the visa in passport, the permit for entrance, residence are the distinctive mark of them. Now quarantine allows us to speculate on and empathize with them at start of new decade (Teller, 2015).
So China, Iran, Italy, Spain, the USA.

These are especially a statement from the current president of the USA and one from the French president and one from the Spanish Prime Minister:

1) ""We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people."" (Trump, USA, 11/3/2020)
2) ""Jamais la France n'avait dû prendre de telles décisions - évidemment exceptionelles, évidemment temporaires - en temps de Paix."" (Macron, France, 16/3/2020)

28,100,"The  sentences  quoted  above  present  different  elements:  the  warfare  language 
and framing used in the first case (Pillar, 2020); similar discourse narrative in the 
second declaration which, although it seems the opposite because the French presi-
dent quotes the word peace is analogous to the first statement’s imaginary. Howev-
er, the intentions might be different since for geopolitical reasons- as we have been 
witnessing  throughout  history-  peace,  contrary  to  war,  does  not  make  noise 
(Kupchan, 2012). And this might be true also when the crisis is different, and the 
enemy is the COVID19 pandemic. Last, but not least, the importance of resilience 
and social solidarity, welfare state, and spirit of communion, as in the last sentence 
with reference to the Spanish case.  The narrative and narratives are important for the FDA analysis of this article. 
Indeed, although often considered far from the field of political science and Inter-
national  Relations,  the  narrative,  with  all  its  implications,  bases  its  power  on  the 
fact  that,  most  of  the  time,  he/she  who  builds  the  story,  is  the  same  to  tell  it 
(Patterson and Monroe, 1998). Technologies of power, and self, intermingle in the 
analysis  of  discourses,  body  of  knowledge  based  on  relations  between  things 
(Foucault, 1988). Additionally, in its two forms of mode of knowing and mode of 
communication (Czarniawska, 2004)4, the narrative has inherent a very high degree 
of rhetoric (Polletta, Chen, Gardner and Motes, 2011; Polletta and Lee, 2006). The 
choice  of  specific  forms  of  communication  certainly  accentuates  it  (Fuchs,  2019)  
and  the  narrative  has  the  role  to  promote  debate  on  a  specific  issue.  However,  it 
puts in place a sort of selection, it does not cover all the issues that echo the pan-
demic and certainly not all the places.  
 ","The quotes above display different attitudes: an aggressive and war-like tone in the first case (Pillar, 2020); a similar tone in the second statement, which may be confusing due to the use of the word ""peace"", but is actually analogous to the word ""imaginary"" used in the first statement
Despite similar tones, the intentions behind the quotes may differ due to geopolitical reasons, as peace does not garner any attention, contrary to war (Kupchan, 2012)
This may be applicable when the enemy is an abstract thing, like the COVID-19 pandemic
The last quote emphasizes the importance of resilience and social solidarity
These narratives are important for the FDA analysis of this study
Although considered far from the ideas of political science and International Relations, the narrative has power because he/she that builds the story, is the same to tell it (Patterson and Monroe, 1998)
The ideas of technology of power and self are used in the analysis of discourses and the body of knowledge based on relations between things (Foucault, 1988)
Also, considering its two forms of mode of knowing and mode of communication  (Czarniawska, 2004), the narrative has a high degree of rhetoric inherently (Polletta, Chen, Gardner and Motes, 2011; Polletta and Lee, 2006)
Having specific forms of communication accentuates this high degree (Fuchs, 2019), and the narrative's role is to encourage debate on an issue
However, the narrative is selective, and does not cover all facets of the pandemic","refer to the sentences quoted above - these present different elements:
the warfare language and framing used in the first case (Pillar, 2020)
similar discourse narrative in the second declaration which, although it seems the opposite because the French president quotes the word peace is analogous to the first statement’s imaginary.
however intentions might differ since for geopolitical reasons - as we have been witness to throughout history -
peace, contrary to war, does not make noise (Kupchan, 2012). 
could this be true also when the crisis is different? and the enemy is the COVID19 pandemic
last but not least the importance of resilience and social solidarity, welfare state, and spirit of communion as seen in the last sentence referring to the Spanish case
the narrative and narratives are important for the FDA analysis of this article
indeed although oft considered outside of the field of political science and International Relations the narrative and embodied implications has power based on the fact that usually he/she who builds the story is the same one to tell it (Patterson and Monroe, 1998). 
Technologies of power, and self, intertwine in the analysis of discourses, body of knowledge based on relations between things (Foucault, 1988)
In addition in its two forms of mode of knowing and mode of communication (Czarniawska, 2004)4, narrative inherent a very high degree of rhetoric (Polletta, Chen, Gardner and Motes, 2011; Polletta and Lee, 2006). 
The choice of specific forms of communication very much accentuates it (Fuchs, 2019) and the narrative plays a part to promote debate on a specific issue
yet it puts in place a sort of selection, it does not cover all the issues that echo the pandemic and surely not all the places.","different elements in above quotes:
- first one uses framing/language of war (Pillar, 2020)
- second is similar, though use of peace by French president makes it seem opposite: discourse is analogous to first imaginary, but with different intent. Geopolitically (witnessed by history) peace, contra war, doesn't make noise (Kupchan, 2012). Could also be true in different crisis: COVID19 is enemy here.
- third: last sentence, Spanish case, shows importance of resilience/solidarity, welfare state, spirit of communion.
Narrative(s) important for this paper's FDA: often not thought of in fields of political science, international relations, but narrative (in all ways) has power because narrative usually constructed by same person as the teller (Patterson and Monroe, 1998). 
Technologies of power, self, come together in discourse analysis, which is about relational knowledges (Foucault, 1988).
""mode of knowing"" and ""mode of communication"" (Czarniawska, 2004) present in narrative also mean it is heavy in rhetoric (Polletta, Chen, Gardner and Motes, 2011; Polletta and Lee, 2006).
Use of certain forms for communication highlights it (Fuchs, 2019); narrative also plays role promoting debate on certain issues--but also promotes selection, doesn't cover all issues echoing pandemic; definitely not all places.",0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,1,0,0,0

Giuseppe Conte (Italian President of the Council of Ministers) spoke decisively. Approved decree of law to isolate one region, then whole country. From beginning, he put down strong measures, declaring emergency on march 1st. Decree by decree, Italian situation is become complicated economically, socially (Fig. 1).

During the discourse, Conte urged for the need to renounce to things, together 
as  Italians,  in  a  collaborative  way.  The  Prime  Minister  used  pervasively  strong 
words by announcing: “Italy protected area/zone” in its totality. He called upon the 
need to act together and to make efforts in order to stop the pandemic, to stop its 
spread out even more. The motto he pointed out was, consequently, clear thanks to 
the hashtag: “#iorestoacasa”12.  In his declarations, Conte did not make direct reference to the damage of the so-
cial fabric. In  Italy the choice of general measures of domestic nature prevails in 
words more than action, especially in the beginning of the pandemic, the emergen-
cy hit the country in an unexpected way. Indeed, in the first weeks, there were no 
visible measures of international cooperation, the power of Conte was in its domes-
tic appeal and in the usage of some war  to get the attention of the online 
audience.  For  instance,  during  the  first  discourse  on  quarantine  he  stated  that  we 
should all thank our “medici in trincea13” and, in a few sentences before this one he 
was  ‘condemning’  young  people  will  to  moments  of  sociability,  to  “fare  aperiti-
vo14” and whatsoever, by later stating “we need to give up to something for a high-
er good, the one of our country”. The Italian Premier used scenarios of death and 
life as huge contraposition. He also embraced the concept of responsibility and mu-
tual responsibility, moving from individuals to national levels. For instance, he de-
clared: 
  
Oggi è il momento della responsabilità, il futuro dell'Italia è nelle nostre mani, che 
devono essere responsabili.15 ","During political discourse, Corte stressed the importance of collaboration with fellow Italians
The Prime Minister used pervasively strong words such as: “Italy protected area/zone”, referring to the country in its totality
He remarked that there is a need to act together if they were to limit and stop the spread of the virus
His motto is given by the hashtag “#iorestoacasa”
In his public statements, Coste never gave direct attention to the damage done to society
In general, Italian culture is more strongly dictated by words rather than actions
In the early stages of the pandemic, there was little or no international cooperation, and with his country being hit hard by the virus, Conte had to leverage his domestic appeal and use war-like language to draw online attention
For example, in the first discourse about quarantines Conte said we should tahnk our “medici in trincea”, and just before this, he was 'condemning' the weak will of young people to socialize, to “fare aperitivo” and such, affirming that “we need to give up to something for a higher good, the one of our country”

pandemic. Its fulcrum it’s the “it’s not my business” attitude from Madrid and the 
Palace of Moncloa. For example, considering, the escalation of the emergency al-
ready in the beginning of March, and having as a reference the Italian, one point to 
discuss is: Why  manifestations  were  not  suspended, as  the  8M (Feminist  demon-
stration during Women's Day, 8 March)  or the strikes all over the country? - For 
example, protests by the farming sector in Zaragoza. However, we could only spe-
culate on the reasons behind these decisions and point out that the UpToDate situa-

3. The Spanish government's reaction to Coronavirus:
In the Spanish case, those in positions of political power had a strong influence in the declaration of ""estado de alerta"" on March 14th
Though prior to this, the situation was grossly underestimated
This may be attributed to the ""it's not my business"" attitude displayed by Madrid and the Palace of Moncloa
By March, the virus was understood to be a threat, as evidenced by the events in Italy, so why were gatherings such as the 8M (Feminist demonstration during Women's Day, 8 March) and strikes like that of the farming sector in Zaragoza not suspended?
We will never know the exact reasons for these decisions, but we can note that the UpToDate situation shows that Madrid contains the majority of cases within the country","sure in the overview of the discourse in terms of Foucauldian discourse analysis (FDA) and construction of reality by means of language and power, polymorphism should not be a stranger.

3. Spanish government and Coronavirus

Conundrum in Spanish case is how political power positions had role in decisions leading to March 14th's ""estado de alerta.""
All political forces in Spain underestimated situation. 
Something notable in how Spain reacted to COVID-19, at it's fulcrum the attitude of ""it's not my business"" from Madrid and the Palace of Moncloa.
F.x., considering escalation of emergency already by March (and with Italians as reference), one key point is: why not suspend manifestations (8M, Women's Day, March 8 feminist demonstrations; strikes all over country, e.g., farmer protests in Zaragosa)?

not fear or listen to the EU discussion and reaction on the issue and appears in a 
similar  situation  to  the  one  a  country  might  experience  during  terrorist  attacks

Thanks to this brief overview, we argue that differences and higher desire for a 
better world made up of cooperation and measures of collaboration. And to answer 
the second question mark in the title of this paragraph: “Yes, we are!”. ","In our last case, we examine Hungary
On March 30th, the Hungarian granted full power to Victor Orbán, who employed populist and nationalist rhetoric

This event displays that discourse was dominated by one group, one person, resulting in this opinion becoming the only ""true"" reality (Foucault, 2000; Waitt, 2010)
Hungary takes an isolationist approach, ignoring EU discussion, and acts similarly to situations such as terrorist attacks (Romania & Tozzo, 2017) or the migration crisis","Last but not least
March 30th - Hungarian parliament gave full powers to Victor Orbán, this was an escalation of populism and nationalism.
thin-centred ideology and a strong bulk of theories came together in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and became practice (Kaltwasser, 2014; Mudde, 2004, 2016).
In fact the decision of the country was to give Orbán total, indefinite power to manage and take all types of decisions as commander in chief with no limit and without any date of expiry.
-this event expresses a hegemonic view and the domination of the debate on the topic by only one part of the society, actually one person

Introduction
Deficits in skeletal health can arise as part of the ageing process, for example during and after menopause in women (1). Lifestyle factors can also contribute to impaired bone health, such as a lack of weight bearing exercise (2). Conversely, high exercise training loads can result in a low energy availability state and the clinical consequences of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) (3), which include adverse effects on bone health (7). Suboptimal bone health increases the risk of bone stress injuries in these exercisers, including stress fractures (4) and complete fractures (5). These types of bone injuries have consequences in terms of morbidity and athletic performance, as well as mortality in the older population (1). Therefore, early identification of those with impaired bone health is crucial. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool FRAX® questionnaire is an effective tool for the identification of adults aged >40 years, at high risk of fragility fracture (6).","Results:

Introduction:
Bone health may degrade as a result of the aging process, such as the change before and after menopause in women (1)
Lifestyle factors may also contribute to poor bone health, including a lack of weight-bearing exercise (2)
However, excessive exercise can lead to a state of energy deficiency and the results of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) (3), including negative effects on bone health (7)
These effects increase the risk of bone stress injuries in exercisers, like stress fractures (4) and complete fractures (5)
Such injuries have negative consequences in regard to morbidity and athleticism in younger populations, and mortality in older populations (1)
This indicates a need for early identification of poor bone health
The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool FRAX® questionnaire was developed for this purpose, and is effective for adults aged >40 years with a high risk of poor bone health","Results

Scoring bone health-screening questionnaire - gave a distribution of bone health scores with lower scores suggesting higher risk for poor bone health

Introduction

Deficits in skeletal health can develop as part of the ageing process, i.e. during and after menopause in women (1). 
Lifestyle factors can also contribute to deficient bone health, i.e. a lack of weight bearing exercise (2). 
Conversely, high exercise training loads can give the result of a low energy availability state and the clinical consequences of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) (3), this includes adverse effects on bone health (7). 
Suboptimal bone health increases the risk of bone stress injuries in these exercisers, that includes stress fractures (4) and complete fractures (5). 
consequences of these types of bone injuries -can be morbidity and athletic performance, as well as mortality in the older population (1). 
Therefore crucial to identify early identification those with impaired bone health. 
The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool FRAX® questionnaire is an effective tool for the identification of adults aged >40 years, at high risk of fragility fracture (6).","Results:
- scoring of questionnaire resulted in distribution of bone health scores: lower score = higher risk of poor bone health.
- for women, range of scores was -10 to +12 (mean of 2.2, SD 4.8)
- for men, range was 0–12 (mean 6.9, SD 3.2) 
- there was positive correlation b/w bone health score off of survey and BMD Z-scores from lumbar spine and femoral neck (p<0.01).

Conclusions:
- this novel bone health-screening questionnaire, accompanied by interview effectively identifies active persons still at risk of fragile bones and that don't get picked up by current methods.
- use of REMS tech to measure bone health is clinically feasible

Intro:
Ageing can lead to deficits in skeletal health, e.g., during/after menopause (1)
Lifestyle factors, like not doing weight bearing exercises, also contribute to poorer bone health (2).
On the other hand, high exercise training loads can lead to low energy availability, with  clinical consequences of RED-S (relative energy deficiency in sport) (3) also including impairment of bone health (7).
Impaired bone health adds to risks of bone stress injuries for such exercisers, e.g., stress fractures (4) and complete fractures (5).
Such injuries have consequences in morbidity and performance, but also in mortality for older individuals (1).
This means that early identification of impairments to bone health is critical.
Hence the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) questionnaire, which is effective in identifying adults over 40 who have increased risk of fractures from fragility (6).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

58,130,"A very appropriate question can be raised at this point: What does universality have to do
with cognitive systems? It is becoming evident that as more detailed data is obtained about
cognitive systems—from finer spatial and temporal recordings of small-scale neuroanatomy to
larger-scale social coordination—the more it appears that they exhibit universal features (Figure 8).
Many natural systems exhibit fractal branching patterns and ratios, for example, coral and neurons
(Figure 8A and B). It is even the case that nonliving and living systems can exhibit the same universal
dynamics. Sandpiles and neuronal networks, for example, can exhibit the same correlation length
among their sand-based and neuron-based avalanches (Figure 8C and D). One universality class that is gaining traction in the life sciences is self-organized criticality (SOC; Bak, Tang, & Wiesenfeld, 1988;
Favela et al., 2016; Jensen, 1998; Plenz & Niebur, 2014; Pruessner, 2012). SOC refers to the
behaviors of a system at different spatial and temporal scales that tend to organize and exhibit
phase transitions near critical states. SOC systems have interactions between components across
scales that yield coherent global patterns of organization.","Now the following question has become very relevant: What is the role of universality in cognitive systems?
More precise data acquisition from cognitive systems, such as spatio-temporal recordings of small-scale neuroanatomy to large-scale social behavior, has shown that they display universal features (Figure 8)

SOC is concerned with the mechanisms of a system at various spatial and temporal scales that allow it to organize and undergo phase transitions near critical states
Systems with this behavior have interactions  that operate across scales that show evident patterns of organization","a very appropriate question to raise at this juncture: what does universality have to do with cognitive systems?
becoming plain that as more detailed data is obtained about cognitive systems - from finer spatial and temporal recordings of small-scale neuroanatomy to larger-scale social coordination - the more it appears that they demonstrate universal features (Figure 8).

Well, as more details come out about cognitive systems (everything from fine spatial and temporal recordings of small-scale neuroanatomy to large-scale social coordination), it seems more and more that they all have universal features (see Figure 8). A lot of natural systems have fractal branching patterns and ratios--just think of corals or neurons (like Figure 8A and B).

Take sandpiles and neuronal networks: they might have the same correlation length between their respective sand-based and neuron-based avalanches (as in Figure 8C and D).

Consequently, the total population within a region at a specified time-step is a function of (i) the size of each age group at the baseline and (ii) the rate of change projected for each age group. Then, also the rate of change of the total population between time-steps is region specific. Such region-specific change is demonstrated (Fig. A6, annex) for Portugal where, for example, in SSP3 a declining population trend for PT11 (Norte), PT17 (Lisboa) and PT16 (Centro Portugal) contrasts with the relatively static total population (and little overall change) observed in PT18 (Alentejo) and PT15 (Algarve).","Considering the baseline, each region has a different set of demographic profiles

Although, for these methods, we apply a stronger assumption - that is, a multiplicative eigenvalue gap is assumed (previous studies considered an additive eigenvalue gap, which is a weaker assumption)
The fields of Private PCA, matrix completion, and low-rank approximation has been a hot topic
The infamous Netflix prize, which started as a matrix completion problem, would soon become a privacy problem
It initially started as a competition open to the public, but was cancelled after realizing the public training sets revealed the private viewing histories of Netflix customers [NS06]
Several approaches to private matrix analysis have been examined: some approximate the data matrix X = (X1, · · · , Xn) ∈ Rd×n, while others approximate the covariance matrix A =∈ Rd×d  (as done in this study)
Still other approximations exist, where a subspace of the whole matrix is produced, and different norms (we use the operator norm between projection matrices) can measure the approximation 
Here, differential privacy is defined to allow a single data point Xi to be changed randomly, while most of the previous work establishes a bound on the norm of variation, or even more strictly, only allows one coordinate of one vector to be changed

We'll talk about this a little later, but the first thing to note is that, in our setting, the thing these have in common is sample complexity n that grows polynomially with ambient dimension d, so none are free from the curse of dimensionality seen in privacy. But we also have a stronger assumption here compared to the others: a large multiplicative eigenvalue gap -- many earlier thinkers assume it to be additive, which makes for a weaker assumption. 

Private PCA, matrix completion, low-rank approximation are subjects of much interest. This could be motivated by, among other things, the Netflix prize -- a sort of matrix completion problem.

Approximation can also take different forms: it's possible to either make a subspace or to approximate the whole matrix, and it can be measured differently (we take into account operator norm between projection matrices).
One thing we do here that is significant is to define differential privacy so that a point, Xi, can be changed arbitrarily. Most others assumed that there was a bound on the norm of the change, or that only one coordinate of one vector is changeable.

Juarrero also notes that constraints do not serve the sole purpose of reducing a system's degrees of freedom, as limitations can result in new possibilities by moving it away from random chance

however - Baumrind et al,[9] and Skieller and Bjork[10] implied that a high mandibular plane angle was not a good predictor of facial growth and that individuals with high mandibular plane angle could have both backward and forward mandibular growth patterns, Nanda.[11] 
researchers found - a well-established sexual dimorphism in the facial dimension had been found to exist by various researchers in the various facial types (Jarabak and Siriwat,[12] Bishara and Jakobsen,[6] Nanda,[13] Schudy[14]). 
So there was a need to segregate the sample according to sex to maintain the homogeneity of the sample.","We divided our 110 subjects here using Jarabak's ratio, same as Wylie[5] and Bishara.[6]
Also included FMA angle.
Selected subjects 18–25 years old so that most growth would be complete and there is a constant skeletal pattern: Brodie[7] noted that facial patterns don't change much once established.
Bishara[6] also concluded, in a longitudinal study, that variations in facial types are more distinct in adults.
Other studies show that facial tissue growth mostly occurs before age 18, even if it's not complete (Brodie[8], Nanda[8]).
Common assumption has been that extreme mandibular plane angles are prognostic of the direction of facial growth.
Baumrind et al.[9] and Skieller and Bjork[10] found, though, that high mandibular plane angle wasn't accurate at predicting facial growth; those with high mandibular plane angles could show either backward or forward mandibular growth. Nanda.[11]

91,186,"To evolve good solutions and to implement natural selection, we need a measure
for distinguishing good solutions from bad solutions. The measure could be an objective function that is a mathematical model or a computer simulation, or it can be a subjective function where humans choose better solutions over worse ones. In essence, the fitness measure must determine a candidate solution’s relative fitness, which will subsequently be used by the GA to guide the evolution of good solutions.
Another important concept of GAs is the notion of population. Unlike traditional search methods, GAs rely on a population of candidate solutions. The population size, which is usually a user-specified parameter, is one of the important factors affecting the scalability and performance of GAs. For example, small population sizes might lead to premature convergence and yield substandard solutions. On the other hand, large population sizes lead to unnecessary expenditure of valuable computational time.","To ensure the implementation of natural selection by evolving good solutions, a measure is needed to determine good solutions from bad solutions

hypothesis is that the transitive matrix verb can case mark the transiting wh-subject:

ex 14","Formal examples of the accusative subject extraction in (13a) made special use of an intermediate step in their derivations
We assume that subject extraction as in (13a) is the nominative variant outlined in section 2.2 above, and especially that the SCrit in the embedded clause is fulfilled by the delayed mechanism outlined in (11) and (12)
Referring to the source of the accusative case on the wh-phrase, consider the part of the diagram in (12b) reproduced in (14): on its way to its final landing site, the wh-subject goes through SpecΦinP1 (an A-position, see below)
This left-peripheral position is never reached by a regular DP subject, which must stop in the embedded (criterial) SpecSubjP
The transiting wh-subject in (14) is now structurally closer to the matrix V than the position held by the regular embedded DP subjects
Based on the setup of (14), we hypothesis that the transitive matrix verb can case mark the transiting wh-subject","Formal accounts of the accusative subject extraction in (13a) make use of a very important intermediate step in the derivation of such examples
we will assume - overall subject extraction in (13a) proceeds as that for the nominative variant as outlined in section 2.2 above, and especially that the SCrit in the embedded clause is satisfied via the delayed mechanism sketched in (11) and (12) previously
with respect to the source of the accusative case on the wh-phrase, put in consideration the subsection of the diagram in (12b) as reproduced in (14): 
on its way to its final landing site, the wh-subject transits through SpecΦinP1 (an A-position, see below). 
This left-peripheral position is never reached by a regular DP subject which (obligatorily) halts in the embedded (criterial) SpecSubjP. 
The transiting wh-subject in (14) has thus reached a spot structurally closer to the matrix V than the position occupied by the regular embedded DP subjects.","Formal descriptions of (13a)'s accusative subject extraction rely on intermediate step to derivate such examples. 
We assume (13a)'s subject extraction to be like the nominative version in section 2.2 (above) - especially that SCrit in embedded clause gets satisfied by delayed mechanism as in (11, 12) given above. 

As far as source of accusative case on wh-phrase, there is the subsection of diagram in (12b), given again as (14): wh-subject transits through SpecΦinP1 (A-position, more below...) on way to final landing spot. Regular DP subject would never get to that left-peripheral spot, because it would have to stop in embedded (criterial) SpecSubjP. (14)'s transiting wh-subject is therefore at a position closer to matrix V than that taken by regular embedded DP subjects.
